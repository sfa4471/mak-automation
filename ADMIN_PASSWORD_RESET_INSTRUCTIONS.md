# What to Tell an Admin Who Forgot Their Password

## For the admin (what they see)

On the **login page** they will see:

**"Forgot your password? Contact your system administrator to reset it."**

So they know: they cannot reset it themselves; they need to ask you.

---

## For you (system administrator)

When an admin (or technician) forgets their password:

1. **You log in** with your own admin account.

2. **On the Dashboard, find the button**  
   - You’ll see a row of buttons: **Create New Project**, **Manage Technicians**, **Tasks Dashboard**, **Reset User Password**.  
   - Click **Reset User Password**.

3. **On the “Reset User Password” page**  
   - You’ll see a list of all users (admins and technicians).  
   - Use the **search box** to find the person (by name or email, e.g. `admin@maklonestar.com`).

4. **Reset their password**  
   - Click **Reset Password** in the row for that user.  
   - Confirm when asked.

5. **Get the temporary password**  
   - A box will appear on the same page with the **temporary password** (e.g. `XyZ9!@#AbC123`).  
   - Click **Copy** to copy it.

6. **Give the password to the user**  
   - Send them the temporary password (phone, email, in person—whatever is secure).  
   - Say: *"I’ve reset your password. Your temporary password is: [paste here]. Log in with it and you’ll be asked to set a new password."*

7. **They log in**  
   - They sign in with their email and the temporary password.  
   - The app will **force them to change the password** right away.  
   - They choose a new password and then can use the app as usual.

## Short version you can send them

You can send something like this:

*"If you forget your password, you can’t reset it yourself. Contact me and I’ll reset it and give you a temporary password. You’ll then log in and set a new password."*
